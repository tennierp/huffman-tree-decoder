## Collaboration & Sources
Dr. Ali A. Kooshesh provided the foundational building blocks of the initial path to take, the pseudocode to build the main.cpp file as well as the scripts to run the project on blue.
This project was built using prior code from the original huffman-tree project encoder to reverse the functions from building the tree to decoding it.

## Implementation Details
This project decodes the files that are created from the HuffmanTree Encoder. It reconstructs the original message from the .txt file using only the .hdr and 
.code files generated by the encoder. The program first reads the .hdr file, which lists each word and its corresponding Huffman code, and rebuilds the original Huffman 
tree structure. Then it reads the .code file bits, traversing the tree to decode each word and writing the output into a .tokens_decoded file. The decoder performs 
error checking to validate that all the files exists, makes sure that the input format is correct, and detects decoding errors such as invalid trees or nodes that 
aren't the correct path. All file and error handling uses the utils.hpp class created by Dr. Ali A. Kooshesh.

## Testing & Status
The decoder was compiled using g++ -std=c++20 -Wall *.cpp -o huffman_decoder.x and executed with ./huffman_decoder.x input_file_name.hdr input_file_name.code.
It correctly reconstructs .tokens_decoded files that match the original .tokens from the encoder. Testing on multiple different sets of files such as TheBells.txt produced 
perfect matches with no decoding errors or file differences. The program passes all validation and edge case tests.
